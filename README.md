# Weak SINDY formulation and model selection via AIC

Obtaining governing equations of forced systems from data is possible through the SINDyC method. Albeit being quite popular, there are some challenges when the data is corrupted with noise. In addition,
it is hard to determine the best sparsity promotion parameter for the algorithm. Hence, to mitigate the noise effect in tandem with the determination of the best thresholding parameter, this 
repository aims to solve this problem.
